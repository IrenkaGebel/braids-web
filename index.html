                LOOKING FOR UNPUBLISHED WRITING BODIES
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9XJaulZqxqgunf8sB0w6GTwm0M0jpexZd1Q942tVcGvLQEg/viewform">submit here</a> until April 1st, 2024 <br>
                
                This year, we’re looking to enter into collaborations with 4 artists/writers and release 4 individual petit journals throughout 2024.<br>
                
                There is no theme. The only requirements are that 1. you must be engaged in a writing practice that excites you; 2. your writing has not been previously published (self-publishing doesn’t count).
                
                Previous braids’s contributors are more than welcome to submit. <br>
                
                <span style="margin-left: 4.5em">What to expect?<br>
                braids is interested in fostering relations rather than end results. We’re hoping to engage in a slow dialogue with each person and approach both writing and publishing as crafts that require love, labour and time. You should be open to editing suggestions, both experimental and practical as well as be interested in delivering visual critique towards the design and format of your publication.</span><br>
                
                <span style="margin-left: 4.5em">If you’re interested, please head to the link above to fill out a google form - you’ll be asked to provide your contact info and a sample of your writing. 
                If you prefer, you can also send your submission via email at hello@braidsjournal.com</span>
                
                <span style="margin-left: 4.5em">Writing sample - it’s best if you submit something you’d want to work on further through this collaboration or that constitutes an impulse for new writing that can happen in the following months. Drafts are preferred over finished pieces. </span><br>
                There is a possibility to meet in person if you’re based in Brussels or Warsaw/Cracow.<br>
                Languages: we’re open to work in English, Polish, French, and Dutch.

            <p><span class="date">(2024/1-2)</span> Working through ideas for the continuation of readclub together with Marcin, Emma, Maddie, Benji, and Szy.</p>
            <p><span class="date">(2023/11)</span> sixth readclub: the dawn of the year heard Ire read <em> Can the
                    Monster Speak?</em> by Paul B. Preciado for a full hour. Accompanied by kindred souls, Paul's
                heart-shaking wisdom was distributed through vains, wires and feelings. It was an intimate conclusion of
                the first series of readclub gatherings hosted on Discord by braids. </p>
            <p><span class="date">(2023/11)</span> fifth readclub: in an impulse to align with the atmosphere of
                autumnal lethargy, we decide to leave out conversation and focus on reading; Ire spends an hour reading
                various
                excerpts from <em>The Long Form</em> by Kate Briggs. </p>
            <p><span class="date">(2023/10)</span> fourth readclub: Maddie reads paragraphs from Maggie Nelson's<em>The
                    Argonauts</em>. we fixate on the heteronormative mug, and attempt to imagine queer family making.
            </p>
            <p><span style="margin-left: 4.5em">third readclub: Ire and Maddie read two chapters from McKenzie Wark's
                    polybiography <em>Reverse Cowgirl</em>. we consider the relation between the book and the body,
                    trace McKenzie's
                    coming to terms with being human and finish off realising that perhaps the only way we're born into
                    this world is
                    through storytelling.</span></p>
            <p><span class="date">(2023/09)</span> second readclub on Discord; Maddie and Ire read the first chapter
                of <em>Freshwater</em>, an autobiographical novel by Akwaeke Emezi. the figure of the python catches our
                attention as we reflect upon the rhythm of the written word, and the shapes of African spirits.
            </p>
            <p><span style="margin-left: 4.5em"> Maddie joins readclub as a co-host alongside Ire; we decide to organize
                    meetings every two weeks on Discord and
                    live-read chosen texts during the sessions. we pick <em>BIRTH</em> as a theme to work with for some
                    time. </span></p>
            <p><span class="date">(2023/07)</span> first readclub on Discord; we look into the conversation between
                Toshi Reagon, Kosisochukwu Nnebe, Ethel-Ruth Tawe Tawe and J. Bob Alotta that took place during MozFest
                in
                Amsterdam this year.</p>

                the
                Hague to discuss braids journal and share desires for future gatherings; the idea for readclub is born.

            <h3>conceived as an archival project, <em>braids</em> journal roams the (potentially) underground with precision and sensitivity in order to find practices that pick the current world apart. </h3>
                <h3>the first edition of the journal was released in January 2023. the project received funding from Stroom Den Haag and assumed its printable form through sensitive attention of Gabriela Galeano Batres, Kexin Hao and Ire. The content of the journal was collected through an Open Call which targeted predominantly The Hague-based, queer artists, alongside pieces by contributors who were asked directly by beuys bois. Each contributor received a fee of 100 euros for their work.</h3> 
                    <h3><em>braids</em> ed. I was printed in Warsaw and distributed to Stroom (The Hague), Page Not Found (The Hague), rile* (Brussels), good press (Glasgow) and ziemniaki i (Warsaw). Copies can also be purchased online.

            <h3>with its inception in the communal space of <em>Unbraiding</em> - a research group, readclub is a play on the traditional book club. it aims to gather readers around texts that spill out of the book format and serve text rather than require pre-reading. readclub is  interested in practices of collective listening and out-loud reading.</h3> 
                    <h3>in 2023 readclub is co-hosted by Maddie and Ire on the braids Discord server: we meet every two weeks to live-read and chat. see our instagram or Discord for most recent updates.

                <h3>it aims to give you the comfort of feeling like you're not alone, in all its impossibility. it aims to be the sensation you get when reading something you've thought about before. it aims to become a network, maybe, i guess, let's see how it goes.</h3>
                <h3>new positions are added regularly.</h3>

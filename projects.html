            <p>braids was conceived by Ire when they were a part of beuys bois - a queer artist collective based in The Hague (NL). they now run it independently from an intersection of
                places.</p>

            <p>conceived as an archival project, braids journal roams the (potentially) underground with precision and
                sensitivity in order to find practices that pick the current world apart. </p>
            <p>the first edition of the journal was released in January 2023. the project received funding from Stroom Den Haag
                and assumed its printable form through sensitive attention of <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/ggaleanob/">Gabriela Galeano Batres</a>, <a
                    href="https://howkexin.com/">Kexin Hao</a> and Ire. the
                content of the journal was collected through an Open Call which targeted predominantly The Hague-based, queer
                artists, alongside pieces by contributors who were asked directly by beuys bois. each contributor received a fee
                of 100 euros for their work.</p>
            <p>braids ed. I was printed in Warsaw and distributed to Stroom (The Hague), Page Not Found (The Hague),
                rile* (Brussels), good press (Glasgow) and ziemniaki i (Warsaw). copies can also be purchased online.

                <p>with its inception in the communal space of <em>Unbraiding</em> - a research group, readclub is a play on the
                    traditional book club. it aims to gather readers around texts that spill out of the book format and serve text
                    rather than require pre-reading. readclub is interested in practices of collective listening and out-loud
                    reading.</p>
                <p>in 2023 readclub is co-hosted by Maddie and Ire on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ex6gemaHfA">braids Discord</a> - we meet every two weeks to
                    live-read and chat.

                <p>minor braid exists as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p5o038mAUHm00SP5cia_VCHdDDGJ-WJ_8olU_2vxEh0/edit?usp=sharing">google sheets</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/minor-braid/table">are.na</a> channel</p>
                <p> thought of as an online sketch of social materialism, minor braid is really an expanded reference list powered
                    by the excitement for humans doing and speaking courageously - an ode to references.</p>
                <p>it aims to give you the comfort of feeling like you're not alone, in all its impossibility. it aims to be the
                    sensation you get when reading something you've thought about before. it aims to become a network, maybe, i
                    guess, let's see how it goes.</p>
                <p>new positions are added regularly.</p>
                <p>if you have any suggestions, we'd be more than happy to receive a message (Discord/email) and consider your
